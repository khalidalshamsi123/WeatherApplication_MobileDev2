My android development skills definitely improved significantly as I built this app. By the first week of mobile development I was very much confused with concepts such as viewBinding but now Iâ€™m familiar with most of the concepts taught in lessons. Building this project definitely  helped gaining those skills. I am satisfied with how the app looks and functions, especially with the dynamic checkboxes and the API requests.

However, there are still very much room for improvement. For one, I wanted to be able to divide the checkboxes as cards that the user could add images to, but I underestimated the time it took for me to learn new skills. The checkbox part of the application took me the longest time. I am satisfied with how it turned out, but my initial plan was more stylised.
Another thing I could have added was a broad cast receiver that resets the app when its 12am. I have tried to implement it but it kept crashing. With the time it took to fix I decided to leave this feature and work on others.

Finally, I would have liked to stylised the night mode of the first page a bit more drastically.
As a result, the app is not as polished as I would have liked it to be. There are still some design choices and features I could have improved but overall I am satisfied with the end result.
